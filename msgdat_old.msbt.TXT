0000A8A5,121,, I still haven't{换行}explained how to train the players, have I?{控制符4}{换行}{控制符3}Would you like to hear an explanation?{控制符1}

0000A91F,200,{控制符2}To train your players, you need to use the{换行}training cards you find during a match.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}The players' abilities will increase according to{换行}the type of training you choose.{控制符4}{控制符2}

0000A9E8,316,Each time you set training for a player, you can{换行}use up to three training cards at once.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}By combining different training cards, you may{换行}discover special combos.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Experiment with different combinations and see{换行}which special combos you can find!{换行}There you go!

0000AB31,901,Boss! What are you doing here? You don't have{换行}any business trips scheduled, that's for sure!{换行}While you're here, let me explain what you{换行}can do in the Airport.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Here you can connect to the internet to take part{换行}in ranking matches against teams from all over{换行}Europe.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}You can play local wireless matches here, and{换行}adjust settings for StreetPass and SpotPass.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Activate StreetPass to be able to play against{换行}any teams you may receive via StreetPass, and{换行}activate SpotPass to receive SpotPass teams.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Both kinds of match can be played from the{换行}Stadium, so go there to see which teams are{换行}available for you to play against.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Now I must dash, I have an important meeting{换行}to attend and I don't want to be late!{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Don't forget, for more details about what you{换行}can do here, touch the ? icon to open the{换行}Manager's Notes.{控制符4}{结束}

0000AF2C,165,Boss, I expect you'll be wanting to get the{换行}players to do some training. Let's head over to{换行}the Team Camp now so that I can fill you in on{换行}the details.{控制符4}{结束}

0000AFD2,304,Go to the Stadium to have friendlies or practice{换行}matches. Remember that playing matches will{换行}earn you training cards.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}You should play lots of matches to make your{换行}team as strong as possible. Are you sure you{换行}want to skip having a match this week and move{换行}directly on to the next week?{待测2}

0000B103,7,{结束}

0000B10B,306,Ah, boss! Just thought I'd let you know that the{换行}fixtures schedule for this season has been{换行}announced at last.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}You can take a look at the schedule in the{换行}Federation, but try to concentrate on winning{换行}your first few matches before you start worrying{换行}about the rest of the season.{控制符4}{结束}

0000B23E,187,As manager, it's up to you to let the players{换行}know what kind of football you envisage them{换行}playing. In the Team Camp, use the Team{换行}Tactics option to put them in the picture.{控制符4}{结束}

0000B2FA,228,Boss, you know that you've got some unused{换行}funds left in the budget, don't you? Why not{换行}use them to further strengthen the team?{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}If you want to, you can make offers for new{换行}players in the Club Office.{控制符4}{结束}

0000B3DF,272,It'll soon be time for the first game of the{换行}season. This will be your first real test at the{换行}club. Whatever the result, I'm sure it'll be{换行}a memorable game for you!{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Once you've made all your preparations, head{换行}over to the Stadium for the match.{控制符4}{结束}

0000B4F0,325,In a practice match, how you play is much more{换行}important than the result. In friendlies, on the{换行}other hand, the fans are present, so you need to{换行}take more care over the result.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}If you manage to beat a stronger team, you'll{换行}make the fans happy, which will in turn give{换行}a boost to your backing rate.{控制符4}{结束}

0000B636,201,A player selected for the All Star team gets the{换行}chance to learn from other top players. Playing{换行}in such a big game should also give him a big{换行}boost and really broaden his playing skills.{控制符4}{结束}

0000B700,249,Boss, we've had some match offers. If you want{换行}to find some more training cards, it might be an{换行}idea to accept some of them.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Remember a practice match only lasts{换行}45 minutes, while a friendly match lasts a full{换行}90 minutes.{控制符4}{结束}

0000B7FA,285,You'll find different training cards depending on{换行}your opponents' capabilities and the situations{换行}that occur during the match.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}It's better to accept friendly and practice match{换行}offers from stronger clubs higher up in the{换行}league if you want to make progress.{控制符4}{结束}

0000B918,177,Players with low stamina can't keep running for{换行}the full duration of a match. When you see one{换行}get tired, you'd be better off substituting him{换行}with another player.{控制符4}{结束}

0000B9CA,302,Focused training teams are now available to{换行}purchase!{控制符4} Play against these teams to be{换行}rewarded with sets of training cards that can{换行}be used together to create special combos.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}The sets you get from playing against the{换行}challenge teams depend on the outcome of{换行}the match.{控制符4}{结束}

0000BAF9,254,In the Squad menu, you can make changes to{换行}your starting line-up and adjust each player's{换行}position.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}The Formations option lets you change the{换行}team's formation. There are some example{换行}formations already in there for you to use.{控制符4}{结束}

0000BBF8,288,In the Team Tactics menu, you can make{换行}changes to the zone, change the team's{换行}emphasis between attack and defence, and{换行}select opposition players for your team to mark.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}You can also make changes to these options{换行}at half-time or whenever you make a{换行}substitution.{控制符4}{结束}

0000BD19,640,Let me give you a bit more information about{换行}what you can do in this menu, boss.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}The zone's important as it marks out your team's{换行}play area. If it's further up the pitch, your players{换行}will stand a better chance of scoring, but you'll{换行}also find that you concede more goals too.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}That's why, at first, your zone's set up not too{换行}far away from your own goal line - to give your{换行}team a bit more defensive solidity.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}It's also important to think about your team's{换行}attacking and defensive balance. It's wise{换行}to assign which of your opponent's players{换行}you want your team to keep an eye on too.{控制符4}{结束}

0000BF9A,252,You can keep hold of the training cards you find{换行}in a match. You don't have to use them right{换行}away.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Sometimes it's better to save them up before{换行}you try to use them. That way you stand more{换行}chance of finding a special combo.{控制符4}{结束}

0000C097,271,In the Team Tactics menu you find in the Team{换行}Camp, you can set the general tactics you want{换行}the team to use in each game.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Once you enter the Stadium, you can use the{换行}same menu there to make tactical adjustments{换行}for that particular match only.{控制符4}{结束}

0000C1A7,301,Different players reach their peak potential at{换行}different stages of their careers.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Players who have passed their peak will{换行}gradually start to lose their potential making it{换行}difficult for them to improve their abilities. Bear{换行}this in mind when training your veteran players.{控制符4}{结束}

0000C2D5,142,Teamwork is improved by playing matches.{换行}Play lots of matches to instil a sense of team{换行}spirit and togetherness in your players.{控制符4}{结束}

0000C364,315,The zone setting in Team Tactics is important{换行}as it marks out your team's play area.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}If it's short, you'll find that it's easier to make{换行}and intercept passes, but your players will get{换行}tired much quicker.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Remember to consider your players' stamina{换行}when setting up the zone.{控制符4}{结束}

0000C4A0,201,As you play in more and more league matches,{换行}your players will get fatigued and are more likely{换行}to get injured in practice or in matches. Make{换行}sure you train up other players as reserves.{控制符4}{结束}

0000C56A,206,Sometimes you'll find that your players aren't{换行}working as a team and aren't attacking. In such{换行}cases, it's worth trying new attacking options to{换行}inject some fresh impetus into the team's play.{控制符4}{结束}

0000C639,227,Boss, when you're playing against stronger{换行}teams, try setting the zone in Team Tactics to{换行}be more defensive.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Also, you can try making the zone more{换行}compact so it's easier to make your passes{换行}connect.{控制符4}{结束}

0000C71D,148,If you keep losing your official matches, why not{换行}try playing a practice match or a friendly to{换行}give your players' confidence a boost!{控制符4}{结束}

0000C7B2,149,Select a player and press the A Button to bring{换行}up the menu.{换行}From that menu, select the Train option to{换行}assign training to that player.{控制符4}{结束}

0000C848,193,Each player's potential peaks at different times.{换行}As manager it's your job to keep an eye on this.{换行}Get the most out of your players by training{换行}them while their potential is high.{控制符4}{结束}

0000C90A,375,Players become fatigued through training and{换行}playing matches. The more a player's fatigue{换行}level builds up, the more likely he is to pick up{换行}an injury, whether in training or during a match.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Be sure to give your players adequate rest{换行}when they become fatigued.{换行}Improving your players' stamina and toughness{换行}will help stave off the onset of fatigue.{控制符4}{结束}

0000CA82,229,Boss, you need to consider each player's{换行}position when choosing what training to give{换行}him.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}For example, improving your goalkeeper's{换行}jumping ability will help him when dealing with{换行}high balls and shots.{控制符4}{结束}

0000CB68,272,Training will affect not just a player's abilities,{换行}but also his movement and positional sense.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Tailor your training depending on each player's{换行}role in the team. For example, "Line Control" is{换行}a good training card to give to a defensive{换行}player.{控制符4}{结束}

0000CC79,187,A player with low willpower might not perform{换行}to the best of his ability in away matches.{换行}Bear in mind whether it's a home or away{换行}match when selecting your starting eleven.{控制符4}{结束}

0000CD35,128,Some special combos will give your player a{换行}new skill or goal celebration that he can then{换行}perform during matches.{控制符4}{结束}

0000CDB6,154,Players have various different abilities, such as{换行}kicking, stamina and others.{换行}Different types of training will improve{换行}different abilities.{控制符4}{结束}

0000CE51,259,Use the training cards you find during matches{换行}to boost your players' abilities. Try to boost the{换行}abilities most relevant to that player's position.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Abilities are ranked from E to S, with E being{换行}the lowest level and S the highest.{控制符4}{结束}

0000CF55,148,Here you can make offers for players who{换行}belong to other clubs.{换行}You can also use the Friend Market to share{换行}players with your friends.{控制符4}{结束}

0000CFEA,318,This player's type has changed!{控制符4}{换行}A player's type affects his movement and{换行}behaviour when he's not got the ball.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}A player's type may change depending on the{换行}training you give him. Consider each player's{换行}position and role in the team when you select{换行}training and special combos for him.{控制符4}{结束}

0000D129,249,Hi boss! I'm the team's physiotherapist. When{换行}one of our players gets injured, I'll do my best to{换行}aid his recovery.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}Players are more susceptible to injury when{换行}they're fatigued. Keep an eye on your players'{换行}fatigue icons.{控制符4}{结束}

0000D24A,194,Pro League 1 is the top level of national football.{换行}Every week, its 12 star-studded teams battle it{换行}out between themselves, all of them cheered on{换行}by legions of loyal fans.{控制符4}{换行}{控制符2}And now

0000D32B,123,a small club managed by a novice{换行}manager appears on the scene, with dreams of{换行}making it to the big leagues...{控制符4}{结束}

00016CC6,79,It appears that he hasn't been given{换行}the chance to play much at{换行}{队名2}.{控制符4}

00016D16,131,It seems like this player spent most of last{换行}season at {队名2} on{换行}the bench. I think he'll be eager to prove{换行}himself useful.{控制符4}

00016D9A,116,His club, {队名2}, are{换行}hovering around the bottom of the table, so{换行}he's hoping to be able to make a transfer.{控制符4}

00016FA4,69,So we're not really sure whether he'll come and{换行}play for us...{控制符4}

0001722B,145,Sorry, but we've already reached our club's{换行}player limit. We can only have 25 players in{换行}total. So, we can't make an offer for him.{控制符4}{结束}

000172C4,160,Sorry, but we've already reached the limit of{换行}players we can receive from the friend market.{换行}The maximum is 16, so we can't make an offer{换行}for him.{控制符4}{结束}

000196B9,19,Still in the clear!

000196D4,23,I'm a little nervous...

000196F3,14,Keep it tight!

00019709,18,Ah, that was soft.

00019723,20,Keep up the defence!

0001973F,17,That's no good...

00019758,19,We're still two up!

00019773,11,We're OK...

00019786,25,We could afford that one.

000197A7,10,Tut tut...

000198A4,20,Slacked off a bit...

000198F2,14,My choice too!

00019920,13,Get stuck in!

00019935,22,We're counting on you!

00019953,15,Run 'em ragged!

000199FB,13,An own goal?!

00019A10,14,What happened?

00019A1F,116,{控制符3}Putting fewer men in defence can be a risky{换行}tactic, but let's hope it pays off with more goals.{控制符4}{结束}

00019A94,108,{控制符3}Three at the back? They should be able to{换行}keep the opponent's attackers under pressure.{控制符4}{结束}

00019B01,172,{控制符3}Three at the back? The defenders won't be{换行}able to take part in the attack as much as they{换行}would with four at the back, but then they are{换行}the defence...{控制符4}{结束}

00019BAE,130,{控制符3}Three at the back? Remember that with fewer{换行}bodies at the back, they'll have to work harder{换行}to fill the gaps.{控制符4}{结束}

00019C31,177,{控制符3}Four at the back? You've more bodies in{换行}defence, but if your wing backs on both sides{换行}can link up with your attack, they'll pose a threat{换行}to your opponents.{控制符4}{结束}

00019CE3,135,{控制符3}Four at the back? Sometimes you'll find that{换行}you're left with only two at the back if your full{换行}backs get forward.{控制符4}{结束}

00019D6B,139,{控制符3}Five at the back? This is the most secure kind{换行}of defence, but you do lose something in terms{换行}of attacking capability.{控制符4}{结束}

00019EFD,154,{控制符3}One up front? Forwards aren't just for{换行}scoring goals, they're also masters at pressuring{换行}the opponent's defence into making mistakes.{控制符4}{结束}

00019F98,174,{控制符3}Two up front? Cooperation between the two{换行}forwards is key. You might need to try several{换行}combinations of players before you find the{换行}perfect partnership.{控制符4}{结束}

0001A047,151,{控制符3}You're going with two up front? Well, as long as{换行}the two of them link up well, we should still{换行}have enough of an attacking threat.{控制符4}{结束}

0001A0DF,127,{控制符3}Three up front? With three in attack, you'll have{换行}more attacking options, which should net you{换行}more goals.{控制符4}{结束}

0001A15F,136,{控制符3}Hm, you've got {数字2} {数字8}?{换行}I'm just wondering how you're going to feed the{换行}ball through to them, that's all...{控制符4}{结束}

0001A1E8,128,{控制符3}You're going with fewer men in midfield.{换行}I'm just wondering how you're going to build up{换行}attacking plays...{控制符4}{结束}

0001A269,108,{控制符3}That's a good balance.{换行}You should be able to get lots of passing moves{换行}going like this.{控制符4}{结束}

0001A2D6,101,{控制符3}I see!{换行}With this set-up, you're aiming to get a{换行}numerical advantage in midfield.{控制符4}{结束}

0001A33C,117,{控制符3}Hm, you've got {数字2} {数字8}.{换行}Well, at least you'll be able to dominate in{换行}middle of the park.{控制符4}{结束}

0001A89B,132,Attacking oriented,{换行}diamond-shaped{换行}formation, with one{换行}defensive midfielder.{换行}Deep attacking plays{换行}are provided by{换行}mobile full backs.

0001A920,149,Midfield arranged in a{换行}square with 2 in attack{换行}and 2 in defence. With{换行}clear role allocations,{换行}the team can switch{换行}quickly between attack{换行}and defence.

0001A9B6,146,A formation with even{换行}distribution of players.{换行}Quick passes keep{换行}the ball under control,{换行}and the three men in{换行}attack threaten the{换行}opponent's goal.

0001AA49,153,The three attacking{换行}midfielders link up with{换行}a lone forward for{换行}various attack options.{换行}Two wing halfs work{换行}the flanks tiring out the{换行}opponent's defence.

0001AAE3,159,4 defenders and 3{换行}defensive midfielders{换行}provide a solid{换行}foundation.{换行}2 attacking midfielders{换行}act as stand-in strikers{换行}adding to the team's{换行}goal-scoring ability.

0001AB83,191,A formation with lots{换行}of attacking players{换行}which will test the{换行}ability of the manager{换行}to effectively combine{换行}individual talents.{换行}Balanced midfielders{换行}are essential for this{换行}formation to work.

0001AC43,159,The deep midfield{换行}makes up for the light{换行}defence. Only one{换行}defensive midfielder{换行}gives multiple options{换行}in attack. Care needed{换行}to defend space on{换行}wings however.

0001ACE3,130,Nicely balanced{换行}formation with two{换行}defensive midfielders.{换行}Two wing backs patrol{换行}the wings contributing{换行}to both attack and{换行}defence.

0001AD66,189,A defensive iron wall{换行}provided by 5 men at{换行}the back. Counter{换行}opponents swiftly{换行}when they grow tired.{换行}The full backs must{换行}work overtime in order{换行}for this to work against{换行}stronger opposition.
